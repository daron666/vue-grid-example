#Cash-Flow Example

###Simple grid component example.

View can be sorted by Index/Category/Total fields.
The values in cells is thousands. (Real value can be computed by * 1000)

This grid component built with vue.js and lodash libraries.
Just simple example.
I intentionally didn't use any kind of gulp/bower/npm tools just to make this example more clearer.
